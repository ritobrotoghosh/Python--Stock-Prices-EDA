# Python--Stock-Prices-EDA

This project focuses on analyzing stock prices through exploratory data analysis. The data spans from March 2006 to December 2015, with a particular emphasis on bank stocks during the 2007-09 financial crisis. The banks under consideration are Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

## Key Findings:

1. CitiGroup had the highest closing price at 564.10, followed by Goldman Sachs at 247.92.
2. Plotting the closing prices of all banks over time reveals a downward trend from mid-2007 to the rock bottom in 2009, reflecting the impact of the Global Financial crisis.
3. Citigroup faced the biggest downfall and never fully recovered, while Goldman Sachs quickly rebounded.
4. Analyzing return percentages, four banks (Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo) experienced their worst single day return on January 20, 2009.
5. JPMorgan Chase had its best single day return the day after its worst return.
6. Citigroup's best return occurred three days after its worst return, while Morgan Stanley's best return occurred four days after its worst return.
7. Citigroup was the most unreliable stock to invest in, while Goldman Sachs provided the most consistent returns.
8. Further detailed study of Goldman Sachs during the recession period showed varying returns mostly between positive to negative 1%.
9. A graph of the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and closing price during the recession period illustrated how fast Goldman Sachs recovered from the crisis, presenting opportunities for investors that some other banks couldn't capitalize on.
10. Exploring correlations between different banks revealed some moderate to high correlations, while others showed none.
